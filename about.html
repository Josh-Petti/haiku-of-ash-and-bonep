        <h1>About Haiku of Ash and Bone</h1>
        <p><strong>A serialized war novel by J.M. Mikael</strong></p>
      </div>

      <p><em>Haiku of Ash and Bone</em> is a long-form serialized war novel set in a brutal, Sengoku-era style world. It follows civilians, soldiers, and people caught between clans, superstition, and survival. This is not a heroic fantasy. Villages burn. People break. Power wins first. Mercy comes later, if at all.</p>

      <h3>Where to Begin</h3>
      <p>This story is released as a free web novel and all chapters are published online, in order, as an ongoing series instead of all at once like a traditional book. Web serials build tension by letting readers follow events as they happen, week by week.</p>

      <h3>Release Schedule</h3>
      <p>New chapters go live on Tuesdays.</p>
      <p>Major updates, new art, music drops, or structural changes to the site are announced through the mailing list. If you want to be notified the moment something changes, join the list. Otherwise, check the Archive.</p>

      <h3>Content Warning</h3>
      <p>This is a violent story. It includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>war crimes against civilians</li>
        <li>psychological pressure, fear, and coercion</li>
        <li>blood, injury, and death on-page</li>
        <li>exploitation and power imbalance</li>
        <li>supernatural horror elements rooted in folklore and belief</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It does not romanticize any of that.</p>

      <h3>Why This Exists</h3>
      <p>Stories like this rarely arrive neat from a publisher. Serialized fiction lets writers tell the story they actually want to tell, build an audience directly, and release in real time without waiting for permission. <em>Haiku of Ash and Bone</em> is being published independently, chapter by chapter, as a record of a world collapsing and the people trying to live through it.</p>
